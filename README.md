This repository contains a personal project focused on distinguishing retinal fundus images from non-fundus images using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project was implemented and visualized as part of an academic presentation at KSIAM 2021.

## 🛠 Features

- Image classification using SVM from `scikit-learn`
- Input preprocessing and simple resizing
- Performance evaluation on a binary classification task (fundus / non-fundus)
- Implemented in Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration
- Visual result samples included
